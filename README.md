# Hello, I'm Ryan Quigley

I am a recent graduate of the University of Cincinnati with a Bachelor's in Cyber Security and IT, currently working as a network engineer focused on zero trust architecture and micro segmentation. I also specialize in NAC solutions and managing firewalls. Prior to this, I was a SOC analyst for a MSSP which operated in the full Elastic stack for both SIEM and EDR. I am passionate about technology and solving complex problems, with interests ranging from network security to offensive security—because I believe the best defense is a good offense. I’m always eager to learn and contribute to projects that challenge and expand my skills.

## Objective

As I continue to grow my career, my primary objective is to continuously develop and enhance my information security skills. Whether through participating in CTFs, or building and experimenting with home labs, I aim to expand my expertise in offensive and defensive security techniques. I am committed to staying ahead in the rapidly evolving security landscape and building a solid foundation for long-term career growth in information security.
